# im_bored
A simple command line tool to get a thing to do if you're bored.

Loosely based off of this YouTube tutorial (but adapted to the Bored API since I'm more interested in things to do than news):

And this Repo:
https://github.com/tuomaskivioja/3-automation-projects

Simply clone the repo, navigate into the directory in the command line, and run 'python3 im_bored.py' to get a thing to do.
